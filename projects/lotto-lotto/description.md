**LOTTO** is an adaptive financial experiment.

The LOTTO token is specifically designed to alter the supply distribution by removing an equal number of tokens from all holders’ wallets simultaneously, and then distribute these tokens to one LOTTO holder at random. This “rebase” process occurs once per day.
