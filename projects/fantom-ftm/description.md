## About Fantom
Fantom is a fast, scalable, and secure layer-1 platform built on an aBFT consensus protocol.

The speed and low transaction costs make Fantom ideal for real world uses, such as payments, supply chain, and DeFi applications among the others.
The technology is used in a pilot program in Afghanistan to help solve the counterfeit drug issue in the region, and itâ€™s the first of many government initiatives that the Fantom Foundation is pursuing.
Fantom also recently released Fantom Finance, an all-in-one DeFi suite that will feature trading, lending, and borrowing directly from the Fantom Wallet. Users can supply the native cryptocurrency to mint several synthetic assets including fUSD, a US dollar pegged stablecoin.
