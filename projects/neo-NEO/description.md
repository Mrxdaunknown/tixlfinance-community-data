## About Neo

Neo explains itself as an open-source, community driven platform that is leveraging the intrinsic advantages of blockchain technology to realize the optimized digital world of the future.

Initially known as Antshares, this project subsequently rebranded to Neo three years later in 2017. Because of itÂ´s infrastructure that allows developers to easily build decentralized apps and smart contracts on its blockchain, Neo is often said to be the Chinese version of the Ethereum network. In contrast to the Ethereum network, developers can use common known programming languages such as C#, Python, Java and JavaScript.

Unlike many other blockchains, this network has two native tokens: NEO and GAS. While NEO serves as an investment token and allows people to participate in votes concerning improvements to the blockchain, GAS is used to pay fees for the transactions that are being completed on the network.

With the development of Neo 3.0, which enhances the network security and allows a greater number of transactions per second to be processed, Neo is making sure to be futureproof and able to cope with sudden increases in demand.
