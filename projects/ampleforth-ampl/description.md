## ABOUT AMPL

AMPL is the first rebasing currency and a key DeFi building block for denominating stable contracts. The AMPL protocol adjusts total supply daily based on market conditions, transferring volatility from price to supply. AMPL’s elastic supply policy does not rely on traditional banks or lenders of last resort, unlike stablecoin models. Because of this unique approach, AMPL can be used as a unit of account for smart contracts in a manner that’s not possible with other cryptocurrencies.

- AMPL has already powered more than $1 billion in on-chain transactions
- AMPL is establishing a truly independent financial ecosystem that exists beyond the reach of politics
- AMPL is a DeFi building block
- AMPL’s elastic supply policy negates the need for lenders of last resort
- Ampleforth’s team combines deep engineering and economics expertise from firms including Uber, Google
- AMPL is blockchain-agnostic. It’s compatible with a growing number of blockchains, including Ethereum, Polkadot, TRON and NEAR.

AMPL is designed to seamlessly integrate with layer one solutions as a cross-chain rebasing currency that powers agreements across the growing smart contract ecosystem.
