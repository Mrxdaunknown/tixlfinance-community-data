**Kleros** is a Blockchain Dispute Resolution Layer that provides fast, secure and affordable arbitration for virtually everything. It relies on game theoretic incentives for jurors to rule cases correctly. The result is a system that renders ultimate judgements enforced by smart contracts in a transparent and decentralized way. Kleros’ vision is to build a decision protocol for a multipurpose court system able to solve every kind of dispute, using smart contracts
and crowdsourced jurors to provide fair, fast, and affordable dispute resolution for digital marketplaces. 

Kleros juror decisions could be
more accurate and less biased than those of centralized dispute resolution platforms because it incentivizes the anonymous arbitrators. Kleros’ goal is to offer more convenience and security to users, with a simple and cost-efficient way to solve disputes. The company proposes a solution for platforms, such as online freelancer marketplaces, where clients can hire freelancers and make Kleros the
adjudication protocol for their smart contract. Should a dispute arise, the funds are locked in the contract and the Kleros arbitration
process begins. 

A tribunal is drawn from a pool of crowdsourced jurors, relevant information is sent to the jurors, and the jurors vote on
the case.
