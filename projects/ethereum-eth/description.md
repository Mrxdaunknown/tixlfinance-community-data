Ethereum is the transactional token of the Ethereum network, which itself is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. It is similar to other cryptocurrencies in that it is a medium of exchange, but it is different in that it has a specific and limited use. Ether facilitates the computation of decentralized apps (dapps) and acts as fuel for the transaction. Apps that are more data-hungry and require more computing power require more ether to operate. Ethererum has a limited supply capped at 18 million Ether per year.

Unlike bitcoin in which the creator who is known as Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The founding team of Ethereum are known individuals which includes Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di lorio, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilke. Not all the founding members are still with the Ethereum Foundation, as some has moved on to work on other projects.
