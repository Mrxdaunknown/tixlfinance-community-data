# Tixl Finance Community Data

In this repository, you'll find all the data listed on the Tixl Finance platform. It's our approach, to be completely transparent about listed projects and exchanges. We'd like to encourage everyone to add new projects, to request exchange re-ratings or to optimize the Tixl Score calculation.

## Who decides about pull requests?

Right now, the Tixl organization will moderate and decide whether a pull request is merged or not. That means that in the eary stages, the transparency of the platform is it's core benefit and not a decentralized management/governance. 

Later on, the goal is to hand over the governance to the community. Potentially, the TXL token will act as a governance token in that case.

## How can you collaborate?

- [Add or update project information](projects/README.md)
- [Add or update exchange information, ratings or adapters](exchanges/README.md)
- [Request a change in the score calculation](score/README.md)
